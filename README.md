# NoServerTexturePacks
### Ever had a server that required you to use their textures? Did they literally copy the entire MC texture files into their resource pack and change 3 things?

This mod allows you to ignore the server and stay connected/play while declining the server texture pack.

Just make sure to hit "Disconnect" when the prompt to use the server texture pack comes up (This mod makes it not disconnect you)

(Also make sure that the server entry is not automatically set to accept the server texture pack, otherwise this mod is useless, obviously)
